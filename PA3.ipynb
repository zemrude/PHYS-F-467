In the second case $R_g \\gg (\\Delta B)$ the magnetic field irregularities are transparent to the particle. However when $R_g \\approx (\\Delta B)$ then the particle *sees* the magnetic irregularities. In this case the particle will scattered almost inelastically in this irregularities. The picture of a test-particle moving in a magnetic field is a simplistic one. In reallity cosmic ray particles propagate in collisionles, high-conductive, magnetized plasma consisting mainly of protons and electrons and very often the energy density of cosmic ray partciles is comparable to that of the background medium and as a consequence, the electromagnetic field in the system is severely influenced by the cosmic ray particles and the description is more complex than the motion of a test charged particle in a fixed electromagnetic field. This will generate irregularities in the magnetic field. The **irregularities in the Galactic magnetic field** are responsible for the **diffusive propagation** of cosmic rays.\n"

In other words, the diffussion coefficient can be understood as the product of the particle velocity $v \\simeq c$ and its mean free path. At high energies, the mean free path between scatterings in the turbulent magnetic clous can be approximate as $l_d = r_L/r_0$, where $r_0$ is the size of the magnetic cloud and $r_L$ the Larmor radius of the particle. Assuming that $r_L \\gg r_0$ we can re-write:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ D = \\frac{r_L c}{3} \\sim \\frac{1}{3}\\frac{E c}{Z eB} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to see this, is to assume that mean diffusion path $l_d$ cannot be smaller than the Larmor radius, since a magnetic field irregularities in a smaller scale than the Larmor radisu will be transparent. This is the regime of the Bohm diffusion and it is possible in higly turbulent magnetic fields, something that theoreticians think is possible when CR excite magnetic turbulence at shocks while being accelerated. This is called magnetic field amplification.\n",
    "\n",
    "In that case, the diffusion coefficient depends linearly with energy ($\\alpha = 1$) and the equation above can be rewritten as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E_{max} \\leq 3 \\frac{u_1}{c} Z e B (u_1 t_{age})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $t_{age}$ is the time in which the accelerator is working. Note that the product $(u_1 t_{age})$ is the radius of a expanding shell. Using some estimates on the time ($t_{age} \\sim$ 1000 yrs as the typical SN shockwave) and $B_{ISM} \\sim 3 \\mu$G we can rewrite the maximum energy for SN shockwaves as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E_{max} \\leq Z\\times 3 \\times 10^4 {\\rm GeV}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In order words, the shock-wave acceleration shown can accelerate CR **up to 100 Z TeV**, but not beyond this. Other acceleration mechanism are needed for the highest energy cosmic rays. We need very high magnetic fields (non-lineal acceleration mechanism). In these cases, even if this object cannot supply the all the galactic cosmic rays the energy per particle may be orders of magnitude higher than those possible in shock acceleration by blast waves.

    "### Supernova Remnants (SNRs)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Supernova remnants (SNR)** remain the most likely candidates for CR acceleration up to at least 10$^{14}$ eV via the Fermi shock mechanism. Supernova explosions are very violent events which transfer a significant amount of energy in the ISM. The explosion mechanism can be the carbon deflagration of white dwarts (Type I) or the core collapse of masssive stars (Type II) but the dynamical evolution of the supernova remnant (SNR) i.e., the expanding cloud of hot gas in the ISM is similar:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Free Expansion Phase.** $M_{ej} \\ll M_{sw}$ The shock wave moves in the ISM gas a highly supersonic speed. The shock radius scales as: $R_s(t) = v_e t$. Behind the shockfront ISM gas starts to accumulate an a reverse shock starts to form. Sometimes we see first this reverse shock. At some point the compressed ISM gas equals the ejected material, this marks the end of the free expansion phase. It last less than 200-300 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Sedov-Taylor Phase.** Once the reverse shock reaches the nucleus, the interior of the SNR gets very hot that energy losses due to radiation are not possible (all atoms are ionized). The cooling of the gas is only due to the expansion, that's why this phase is the adiabatic phase. The radius goes as $R \\propto t^{2/5}$. When temperature reaches the critical value of $10^{6}$ K ionized atoms start to capture free electrons and can lose energy due to de-exitation. This is the end of the adiabatic phase. This phase can last 20,000 years. *This is the phase when Cosmic Rays are mostly accelerated*. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Cooling or Snowplough phase** Due to the effective radiative cooling the thermal presure decreases and the expansion slows down. More and more interstellar gas is accumulated until the swept-up mass is much larger than the ejected material. Finally the shell breaks up into clumps probably due to Rayleigh-Taylor inestabilities. This phase lasts up to 500,000 years.\n",
