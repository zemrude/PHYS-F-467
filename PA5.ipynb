X-rays are typically below 100 keV. Photons with E > 100 keV are called gamma-rays. "

    "### Spectral Energy Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "In gamma-ray astronomy is usual to study an object emission by its spectral energy distribution (SED).  The SED on an object is its energy emitted plotted against some measure of the photon - frequency or wavelength. The reason astronomers do this is to see how much energy is produced by the object as a function of frequency or wavelength. The SED is typically characterized by $\\nu F_\\nu$ and it is measured in units of ergs cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, ie. it indicates the rate of energy emitted per surface. The function $F_\\nu$ is the flux density which indicates the rate of energy emitted per surface and also per frequency, so it is expressed as ergs cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$. All of this doesn't need to be confused with the spectrum! which is what we are being using to characterize CRs. In CR physics spectrum in the rate of particles per unit energy and surface and it is measured on GeV$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ s${-1}$. The spectrum multiply by energy, gives you the rate of particles per unit surface. Multiplying again by energy give use the energy rate per unit surface. Therefore we have the relation:\n",

On the other hand an accelerated electrical charge radiates electromagnetic waves! which... will slow down the particle... \n",
    "\n",
    "The reason of this aparent inconsistency comes from the fact that we treat the electric field lines as the purely Coulombic action-at-a-distance. One has take into account that as a particle moves, the electric field lines need to *re-arrange* and this re-arrangement cannot happen at a speed faster than the speed of light. \n",

    "Let's assume that the particle is at rest at the moment $t=0$. The electric field lines clearly point away from the origin. At that moment the particle accelerates which brings the velocity of the particle to $\\Delta v$ in a time $\\Delta t$, after that the particle continues with uniform velocity. "

The problem with the re-emission of low frequencies as a black-body radiation is that a power-law distribution does not have a characteristic temperature.

    "Compton discovered that photons can transfer part of their energy to electrons in a collision. In astrophysics the inverse Compton effect electrons accelerated to high energy collide with photons from the blackbody radiation (thermal photons) or starlight photons and transfer energy to them. \n",
    "\n",
    "In astrophysics the inverse compton scattering is very important as a fast electrons that produce the synchrotron component can hit a low-energy photon and transfer a large fraction of its energy to the photon. For low energy photons, the scattering is elastic, and this regime is called the classical *Thomson regime*. However, for high energy photons where $E_\\gamma \\gg m_e c^2$ the scatting is not elastic and the energy of the scattered photons changes. This regime is called the *Klein-Nishina*. The cross-section for this *inelastic* scattering is given by:\n",

    "#### Maximum energy of inverse Compton\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume the lab reference system, $O$, and the electrons rest frame system $O^\\prime$. The energy of the photon is then given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E_{\\gamma,in}^\\prime = \\gamma E_{\\gamma,in} (1 + \\beta \\cos\\theta)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\gamma$ and $\\beta$ refer obviously to the electron. Since in the electron's rest frame the scattering happens at low-energy we can assume that the scattering is described by the elastic Thomson regime, ie, the photon is scattered with the same energy in the electron's rest frame. Going back to the lab frame we have then:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E_{\\gamma,out} = \\gamma E_{\\gamma,out}^\\prime ( 1 + \\beta\\cos\\theta^\\prime)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "but $E_{\\gamma,in}^\\prime = E_{\\gamma,out}^\\prime$. The maximum energy transfer will be that of a head-on collision in which the electron $\\cos\\theta = \\cos \\theta^\\prime = 1$ is bounced backwards we have that:\n",

    "As electrons are moving in an isotropic photon field the will see mostly head on collitions. So the energy spectrum of of scattered photons peak close to the maximum frecuency. This relation is very important for astrophysics, because it tell us a relation between the energy of electrons and the spectrum of photons. We know there are electrons with $\\gamma \\sim 100 - 1000$ and therefore the resulting photon emission is of very high energy. For example assuming electrons with $\\gamma \\approx 1000$ we have:\n",

    "\n",
    "$${\\rm d} n(E) \\propto E^{-p} {\\rm d} E$$\n",

    "As we saw, blazars are a particular classification of AGNs with their relativistic plasma jet oriented close to the line of sight. Because blazars have their jets pointing towards, the full emission comes from a relatively small region (the width of the jets) and so these objects can exhibit rapid variability (due to the smaller causally connected regions). The typical SED for AGNS is characterized by a synchrotron component extending from radio to X-ray frequencies, and a second component peaking at gamma-ray frequencies due to either inverse-Compton radiation (or from hadronic processes). The plot below shows the spectral energy distribution of nearby (z = 0.044) blazar 1ES 2344+514 during a flaring and a quiet state."

The absortion is energy dependent and increases with distance. Observations of very far distant AGNs can be used to put constrains on the amount of EBL. However it is difficult to distinguish between an intrinsic softening of blazar spectra and a softening caused by the interaction with low energy EBL photons.

    "### Diffuse flux of Astrophysical Neutrinos\n",
    "\n",
    "The first detection of high-energy neutrinos of cosmic origin in 2013 by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory opened a new window to the non-thermal processes in our universe. The  first  strong  evidence  for  a  cosmic  neutrino  component  came  from a  search  using  data  from  May  2010  to  April  2012  [35],  where  two  shower-like events from interactions within the detector with energies above 1 PeV were discovered.  A follow-up search for events starting in the detector with more than 30 TeV deposited energy that utilized the same dataset identified 25 additional high-energy events.  The spectrum and zenith angle distribution of the events was incompatible with the hypothesis of an atmospheric  origin  at > $4\\sigma$. IceCube  has  since  collected  independent  evidence for an astrophysical neutrino signal by analyzing different event signatures.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Starting Events\n",
    "\n",
    "Neutrino interactions are identified in IceCube by searching for an interaction  vertex  within  the  instrumented  volume.   This  search  is  sensitive  to both shower-like and track-like events.  Since the main background for this\n",
    "search is comprised of muons from CR air showers, the rejection strategy is to identify Cherenkov photons from a track entering the detector.  For that, the outer parts of the instrumented volume are assigned to a “veto” region. An event is rejected if a certain number of Cherekov photons are found in this veto region at earlier times than the photons produced at the interaction vertex. The energy threshold for this analysis is about $E_\\nu \\sim 30$ TeV.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Through-going muons\n",
    "\n",
    "Muons  produced  in  CC  neutrino  interactions  far  outside  the  detector can still reach the instrumented volume to produce track-like events.  Even at  1  TeV  a  muon  can  penetrate  several  kilometers  of  ice  before  it  stops and  decays.   This  allows  observation  of  high-energy  neutrino  interactions from  a  much  larger  volume  than  the  instrumented  one,  thereby  substantially increasing the effective area of the detector.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The spectral fit\n",
    "\n",
    "The results of a combined analysis fits the neutrino flux to a power-law between 27 TeV and 2 PeV consistent\n",
    "with an unbroken power law with a best-fit spectral index of $-2.49 \\pm 0.08$ given by:\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "However using only the high energy through-going muons (abouve 200 TeV) yields  a preferred spectral index of $-2.13\\pm 0.13$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Search for Point Sources\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case where the cosmic neutrino flux is dominated by bright individual sources, they should be detectable as a local excess of events on the sky  with  respect  to  the  atmospheric  neutrino  and  diffuse  cosmic  neutrino\n",
    "background.  The sensitivity of a search for such features depends crucially on the precision by which the direction of the neutrinos can be reconstructed from the data, i.e.  on the detector angular resolution. No indication for a neutrino point source has been found in the IceCube data so far. The null result of a point-source of neutrinos, can be transformed into an flux upper limit at a given confidence level. This upper limits represents the neutrino flux that we can be certain to exclude, since IceCube did not see a point source."
